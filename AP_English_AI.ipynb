        "  Humans are aperantly at the top of the food chain, and are considered the higher animals. The reason for this is thanks to our Moral sense(ability to distinguish good from bad). Yet this same moral sense has made us dispicable beings, incapable of inosence, at times. We voluntarily commit evil acts, knowing these will have destructive effects. On page 2, Mark Twain demonstrates a comparison between cats and humans. Cats are innocent and when the do wrong , they are not aware of it due to their lack of moral sense, which saves them or makes them unguilty. On the other hand, man is concious. Man is not innocent, because of the moral sense man is aware of his actions, and when commiting dispicable acts; man finds pleasure in this, making man not innocent. As Mark Twain expresses on page 1, man always wants more and more. The more man has the more he wants and the worst the acts will become, feeding the greed. Man will even go so far to harm his own moral kind, being inconsiderate of the values that we share. In contrast to animals in the wild, they dont \"accumulates\" food but rather eat and leave what is left over. Man \"accumulates\" what he needs and dosnt need, with what seems no limit. (page 4) Instead of the highest animal, humans should be the \"lowest\". After each that we do, we keep finding more and more pleasure to fuel our greed to redo these acts, as it it wasnt enough.\n",

        " Even with today's modern civilization, advanced politics and other fields, the time when humans should be getting along the most is today (according to past predicitons of the future). Yet it is the opposite, they say that the most powerful should protect the least powerful(storng protect the weak), but today the most powerful takes advantage of the poor and the poeple who have little to no say because of the enourmous influence that the people in power have. On page 3, Donald J Trump is used as an example of curelty. Trump's administration was searching to cleanse mnore than 193,000 American imigrant children, after those children's protection status was nulified by the same administartion. Trump's administartion wasnt only seeking to export illegal imigrants from US, but he was alos seeking to curely setup up those who had legal protetcion to fail and be exported as well. This by it's own is a very cruel act, showing hatred towarsd innocent people who had temporary legal protected status. On teh same page, and page 5; Trump ridiculed a psychology professor, Christine Blasely Ford, who claims that life-time nominated Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, has attempted to rape her as a teenager. In a live public Mississippi rally, Trump's supporters supported Trump's cruel act, and shouted \"Lock her up!\", cheering Trump on. There was also cruelty at the USA borders, with patrol agents laughing at the crying imigrant children who were seperated from their families. Among the other many thse are some inyteresting occurance;  police laughed upon being encouraged to abuse suspects by Trump, Fox News hosts mocked survivor of Pulse Nightclub. Trump not only gets satisfaction from doing these types of acts, but he also enjoys encouraging others to do the same, and others follow up into the cruelty, turning everyone into a mentaly cruel America, something they werent before. This dispicable wave overflows through Trump and his supporters, showing the true nature embraced and re-enforced by them.\n",

        "  There many things to be achivied with every new technology humans invent or discover. But are these technologies and knew resources worth betraying your other fellow human beings? As a person in power, responsible for the well-being of your citizens, do personal interest, or any other interest other than the well-being of your fellow humans, out weight the well-being and the general value of humans? Come to think about it, without the well-being of humans, there cant be any progress done outside of the necesities of each individual. If an individual does not meet it's necesities, they are not efficient and the same follows up for upcoming generations. Unfourtunatetly, the govenrment prefers other objectives over human values, they prefer to send a man to the moon at the cost of innocent American peace and well being.(Verse 1) The author starts with a special harmful event that happened to his sister, as her face and arms bulged up, yet \"and whitey's on the moon\".(Verse 2 and 3) The author's rent increased, there was no water and toilets nor lights, and there were doctor bill sto be paid for his sister's inury. The living standards of the author, and others like him, didnt meet the minimal standards and health support could not be afforded, but there is still a man on the moon. With each  verse including \"whitey's on the moon\"; no matter the maginitude of the occurances in the verse, there is a man on the moon sent by using the money that belongs to the American's like the author.(Verse 6) No matter the amnount of money made, it went all to the govenrmenmt through taxes and overpriced goods and services, all to send a man to the moon. It is hard enough to survive as a low living standard person, and cruel for the one system that is supposed to protect the rights and well being of citizens, to overcharge services and goods, increase taxes, to then collect the money needed to send a man to the moon. The moon resources can wait, they will not disapear, but humans have a life span which shortens when they are not in well enough confitions. Large amounts of money is needed to sned a man to the moon. The money used for that could've been used on the basic needs of Americans, in turn these Americans will be more efficient at their roles and works, making more money and discoveries. But after you spend money on the moon, it is highly probable you will get little to no money back, no matter the amount. \n",

        "   Though humans can be very dispicable, it can be understood that perhaps those who are, in fact just misunderstand the proper way to think about others. People who embrace the dispicableness might not truly be doing it with super bad intentions based on hatred and satisfaction, but based on a wrongful belief and the peer preasure from the surrounding people in their clan or group. The peer preasure forces the supporters of the group to do certain things in order to fit in and not lose their community support and love. Some bible texts might also be mis-interpreted, like in the bible (Verse1 Peter 2:18); \"Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear.\" humans can misundertand it as to enslave those who are less than them, because humans are selfish and believe that they are better than others that are different. Pages # through #, Dr.King's letter is introduced. Dr.King starts his letter with a nice peaceful introduction \"Hello my fellow CLergy men\", followed by the introduction to the main problem. The clergy men claimed that Dr.King is an outsider, yet he was born in the US. While Dr.King defends himself inteligently and peacefully without brining himself down to the their level, claiming he is not an outsider. On page # ----------//talk about the text evidence, restating it-------------\n",
        "Just like Dr.Kign there are many who have tried and those who are trying to fix the misunderstood idea of doing the wrong thing, but there are those who try to divereg the good deeds and the good intentions of others, dragging them into a false sense of reality and decission making, all because they want to be part of something and desire to be included.
